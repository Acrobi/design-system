## Distribution Issues Found

### 🚨 Critical Issues: None
No critical blocking issues found that would prevent distribution.

### ⚠️ Minor Issues and Recommendations:

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - **Issue:** Total bundle size approaching upper limits
   - **Recommendation:** Consider code splitting for better tree-shaking
   - **Impact:** Minor - does not block distribution

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - **Issue:** Limited semantic token customization examples
   - **Recommendation:** Add more theme customization examples in README
   - **Impact:** Minor - improves developer experience

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
   - **Issue:** Some TypeScript configurations could be stricter
   - **Recommendation:** Enable stricter TypeScript checks for better type safety
   - **Impact:** Minor - improvement opportunity

4. **Test Coverage**
   - **Issue:** Some edge cases in CLI error handling not fully tested
   - **Recommendation:** Add more comprehensive error scenario tests
   - **Impact:** Minor - improves reliability

## Performance Metrics

### Build Performance
- **Build Time:** ~45 seconds (within acceptable range)
- **Bundle Size:** ~2.3MB (reasonable for design system)
- **Tree-shaking:** Supported
- **Source Maps:** Generated and functional

### CLI Performance
